# Car Rental System

A full-featured car rental management system that enables real-time reservations, rental tracking, and operational reporting. It combines a SQL-based relational database with a C# front-end interface, with optional Python scripts used to visualize performance and customer behavior.

## Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a relational database system to support the operations of a car rental agency. The system allows customers to view and reserve available cars by date, branch, and car type. Branch employees can manage car inventory, customer records, and rental transactions. It ensures accurate booking, availability checks, and automated fee calculations.

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL Server – Database backend
- C# (.NET) – User interface (Windows Forms)
- GitHub – Version control and collaboration

## Database Schema

The system includes five main tables:

- **Customer** – Personal information, insurance, driving license, and membership status
- **Branch** – Rental and return location details
- **CarType** – Defines vehicle categories and cost structure
- **Car** – VIN-based tracking and availability status
- **Rental** – Transaction records with pickup, return, and fee data

Referential integrity and constraints ensure valid and consistent entries.

## Features

### For Customers

- View available cars based on date, branch, and type
- New user registration with automatic ID assignment
- Complete rental transactions with booking confirmation

### For Branch Staff

- Add, update, or delete cars, branches, customers, car types, and rentals
- Check vehicle availability and create rental contracts
- Return cars and calculate final costs, including late fees
- Automatic "Gold Membership" upgrade for customers with 3+ rentals in a year

### Reporting and Insights (via SQL)

All reports and performance insights were generated by writing custom **SQL queries** directly on the relational database. These queries are supported:

- Calculating rental revenue by branch and time period
- Identifying branches with the highest and lowest rental activity
- Detecting customers renting repeatedly from the same branch
- Highlighting branches with no rentals during a selected timeframe
- Listing customers who rented only within their home city
