# Car-Rental-System
This project involves designing and implementing a relational database system to support the
operations of a car rental agency. It is a user-interactive application where a user is allowed to
perform car rentals. They have a variety of options to choose from. This system allows the
customer to make a reservation based on the availability of the car, time slots, and locations.
The customer can view available cars and select from available dates and branches to rent. The
branch member can add, delete and modify Customer, Branch, Car, CarType, and Rentals
information.
